### Project: Design and Implement a Zero Trust Network

### Objective:
Create a network architecture based on Zero Trust principles, where no entity (internal or external) is trusted by default. Verify and authenticate every connection attempt, enforce strict access controls, and continuously monitor the network.

### Components and Workflow:

1. **Identity Verification and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
2. **Least-Privilege Access Controls**
3. **Network Segmentation**
4. **Continuous Monitoring and Logging**
5. **Incident Response Plan**

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

#### Step 1: Identity Verification and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

##### 1.1 Set Up Identity Provider (IdP)

Use a service like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Okta.

**Azure AD Setup:**

1. **Create an Azure AD Tenant**:
   - Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" and create a new tenant.

2. **Add Users**:
   - In the Azure AD blade, go to "Users" and add new users.

3. **Configure MFA**:
   - Go to "Security" -> "Multi-Factor Authentication".
   - Enable MFA for users.

**Okta Setup:**

1. **Create an Okta Developer Account**:
   - Sign up at [Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

2. **Add Users**:
   - Navigate to "Directory" -> "People" and add new users.

3. **Configure MFA**:
   - Go to "Security" -> "Multifactor" and enable factors such as SMS, Google Authenticator, etc.

##### 1.2 Enforce MFA

Ensure all users are required to use MFA for accessing critical resources.

```yaml
# Azure AD Conditional Access Policy (example)
name: "Require MFA for All Users"
conditions:
  users:
    include: All
  apps:
    include: All
controls:
  access:
    grant:
      include:
        - mfa
```

#### Step 2: Least-Privilege Access Controls

##### 2.1 Define Roles and Permissions

Identify the roles within your organization and define the minimum permissions required for each role.

**Example Roles**:
- Administrator
- Developer
- HR Staff
- Finance Staff

##### 2.2 Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Use your IdP to assign roles and manage access permissions.

**Azure AD RBAC Setup:**

1. **Create Roles**:
   - Go to "Azure AD" -> "Roles and administrators".
   - Create new custom roles with specific permissions.

2. **Assign Roles**:
   - Go to "Users" -> "User settings".
   - Assign roles to users based on their job functions.

**Okta RBAC Setup:**

1. **Create Groups**:
   - Navigate to "Directory" -> "Groups".
   - Create groups for each role (e.g., Admins, Developers, HR, Finance).

2. **Assign Permissions**:
   - Assign applications and permissions to each group.
   - Add users to the appropriate groups.

##### 2.3 Enforce Least-Privilege

Ensure that users only have access to the resources necessary for their roles.

```yaml
# Example IAM Policy for AWS
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Step 3: Network Segmentation

##### 3.1 Define Network Segments

Segment your network into isolated zones based on trust levels and functionality (e.g., DMZ, internal network, development environment).

##### 3.2 Implement Segmentation with Firewalls

Use network firewalls to enforce segmentation.

**Example using Palo Alto Networks Firewall:**

1. **Create Security Zones**:
   - Define zones for different network segments (e.g., DMZ, Internal, Development).

2. **Create Security Policies**:
   - Define policies to control traffic between zones.
   - Example Policy: Allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic from DMZ to Internal.

```xml
<entry name="allow-dmz-to-internal">
  <from>
    <member>DMZ</member>
  </from>
  <to>
    <member>Internal</member>
  </to>
  <source>
    <member>any</member>
  </source>
  <destination>
    <member>any</member>
  </destination>
  <service>
    <member>application-default</member>
  </service>
  <action>allow</action>
</entry>
```

#### Step 4: Continuous Monitoring and Logging

##### 4.1 Set Up SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

Use a SIEM tool like Splunk or ELK Stack for centralized logging and monitoring.

**Splunk Setup:**

1. **Install Splunk**:
   - Download and install Splunk Enterprise.

2. **Configure Data Inputs**:
   - Configure inputs to collect logs from various sources (e.g., firewalls, servers, applications).

3. **Create Dashboards**:
   - Create dashboards to visualize security events and alerts.

**ELK Stack Setup:**

1. **Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana**:
   - Follow the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html) to install and configure ELK Stack.

2. **Configure Logstash**:
   - Set up Logstash to collect and process logs.

```json
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/auth.log"
    type => "auth-log"
  }
}
filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGBASE} %{DATA:auth_message}" }
  }
}
output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
    index => "auth-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}
```

3. **Create Visualizations in Kibana**:
   - Use Kibana to create visualizations and dashboards based on the collected logs.

##### 4.2 Implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

Deploy EDR solutions like CrowdStrike or Carbon Black to monitor and respond to threats on endpoints.

**CrowdStrike Setup:**

1. **Deploy CrowdStrike Agent**:
   - Install the CrowdStrike Falcon agent on all endpoints.

2. **Configure Policies**:
   - Set up policies for detection, prevention, and response.

#### Step 5: Incident Response Plan

##### 5.1 Develop an Incident Response Plan

Create a comprehensive incident response plan outlining procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.

##### 5.2 Implement Incident Response Procedures

Ensure all team members are trained on the incident response plan and conduct regular drills.

**Incident Response Runbook Example:**

1. **Identification**:
   - Monitor alerts from SIEM and EDR tools.
   - Confirm and classify the incident.

2. **Containment**:
   - Isolate affected systems.
   - Implement network segmentation to prevent lateral movement.

3. **Eradication**:
   - Remove malicious software.
   - Patch vulnerabilities.

4. **Recovery**:
   - Restore systems from backups.
   - Verify system integrity.

5. **Lessons Learned**:
   - Conduct a post-incident review.
   - Update the incident response plan based on findings.

### Conclusion

By following this step-by-step tutorial, you have implemented a Zero Trust Network architecture. This involves setting up identity verification and MFA, enforcing least-privilege access controls, segmenting the network, continuously monitoring and logging network activity, and developing an incident response plan. This comprehensive approach helps ensure that all connections are authenticated and authorized, providing a more secure network environment.
